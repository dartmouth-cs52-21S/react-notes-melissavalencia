## What Worked Well
Once I got the hang of writing the arrow functions and making sure I was passing the correct data, it came together! The firebase implementation wasn't as difficult as I thought it was going to be. The methods that Immutable.js provides were also super useful and fairly easy to implement.
## What Didn't
Firebase was a bit tricky to figure out at first because I did not know where all the configuration information was coming from, until I actually set up the authentication and storage. React Markdown was also giving me a hard time only because I had a space before a curly brace. Thankfully, I caught that but I had spent a while trying to figure out why the text was not rendering on the notes and it was because of that space. I also had some difficulty making sure I was passing the correct function and not confusing the function names.
## Extra Credit
Moving the notes in the zIndex.
